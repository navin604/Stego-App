# Steganography GUI Application

## What is it
This application provides an interface for Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography.

## Prerequisites

The following dependencies are required:

- ImGUI (DirectX12 + Win32)
- CryptoPP
- OpenCV

CryptoPP and OpenCV lib's are required. I will add scripts to build and move those .lib's into the correct location sometime in the future.

If you happen to manually acquire the required libraries, make the necessary changes to the premake script and run the batch file to generate project files.
